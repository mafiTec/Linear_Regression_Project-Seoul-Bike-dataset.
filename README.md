- <b>project Description:</b>Using recorded weather forecasts i trained a model which predict the possible amount of customers would be interested in renting a bike for a             particular day

    - Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul

    - Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
    - Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration
